## some ideas to consider - 
toogle light and dark mode via prompt/speech
schedule a meeting by prompt/speech
navigate by prompt/speech
search by prompt/speech

## other ideas [to be evaluated]
Generate dynamic hero via Stable Diffusion stub + audio layer prototype

AI as Co-Host, Not Sidebar
• Instead of a tiny chat widget, embed a voice-first “studio assistant.” On page load, it greets you, offers to “take you on a tour,” and narrates highlights (text-to-speech + speech-to-text).

Generative Flair
• On each page load, generate a custom hero graphic via a tiny off-screen model (Stable Diffusion API). Your brand is never static—it’s always freshly crafted.

files/folder structure

prompt rules;
colocate as much as possible
maintain a flat folder structure
when required to make a coding change/update you must focus on making substantial updates/changes, add necessary comments, do not make formating or linting changes/updates!

do not make assumptions, ask questions when in doubt, strictly follow the instruction/request
always use hooks from usehooks-ts when possible - https://github.com/juliencrn/usehooks-ts
